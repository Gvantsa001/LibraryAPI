This is a simple RESTful Web API for a bookstore built with ASP.NET Core
. It allows clients to perform CRUD operations on books and authors. The API uses Entity Framework Core for ORM and connects to a SQL Server database.

- **Books Management**: 
  - Add, update, retrieve, and delete books.
  - Each book has a title, year of publication, and author.

- **Authors Management**: 
  - Add, retrieve, and update authors.
  - Each author has a list of books.

- **Swagger Documentation**: The API is well-documented using Swagger, providing interactive API documentation for testing the endpoints.
